    * Migrated the Haas Undergraduate Cohort Program away from the legacy
    standard of junior and senior cohorts, and to class-agnostic 4-cohort system
    that is inclusive to freshman and sophomore Haas students such as M.E.T. and
    G.M.P. members.

      * The new cohorts are Axe, Bear, California, and Oski!
    * Oversaw the integration of the M.E.T. program into the operations and culture of the Haas School of Business by ensuring that new policies, initiatives, and organizational changes equitably consider M.E.T. students.
