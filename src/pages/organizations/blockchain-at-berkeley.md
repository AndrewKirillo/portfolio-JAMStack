#### Instructor & Researcher

* Built a platform to run simulated market experiments with configurable stablecoin protocols, agent behaviors, orderbook parameters, and asset price feeds.

  * Used this to investigate DeFi's " Black Thursday" event that hit the crypto markets on March 12th, 2020, and specifically the stability implications for the Dai protocol.
* Taught our Blockchain Fundamentals course to a class of 50 students.

  * Taught the lectures on game theory, scalability, and enterprise blockchain.
* Organized a series of summer workshops with the UC Berkeley Academic Talent Development Program (ATDP) that taught middle and high schoolers about blockchain technology.
