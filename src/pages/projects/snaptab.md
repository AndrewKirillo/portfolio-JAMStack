#### Creator

* Say goodbye to hoarded tabs, and say hello to SnapTab! SnapTab's signature "snapshot" feature lets you save all of the tabs currently in your browser window with one click. You can access and edit your snapshots from SnapTab's intuitive dashboard for later use.

  * A Chrome extension built with React, runs completely locally in the browser.
