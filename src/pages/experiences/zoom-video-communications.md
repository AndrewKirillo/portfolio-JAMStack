#### Marketplace Developer Intern

* Architected a video content management system (CMS) and discovery platform for Zoom Webinars with an integrated social network made up of brand-able channels, including 3rd party marketing integrations and a video analytics suite.

  * This was a prototype for a new product offering that was pitched to the CEO, Eric Yuan, and now a limited set of the proposed features is being experimented with on the Zoom website.
  * Built using a Node backend communicating with the Zoom Webinar API, AWS DynamoDB, and AWS S3; linked to a React frontend, hosted on AWS EC2.
* Developed 2 of the first 100 apps for the Zoom App Marketplace, each of which were chatbot-based integrations for 3rd-party SaaS products.

  * These were created using a Node backend that utilized AWS DynamoDB and the Zoom Chat API to trigger 3rd-party API actions. Each bot also included a React configuration page, was hosted on AWS Lambda, and was deployed through a Jenkins pipeline.
* Deliberated with product specialists from our integration partners, such as Qualtrics, to hash out appropriate use cases, feature sets, and product roadmaps.
