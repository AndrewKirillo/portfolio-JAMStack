Hey there!
I'm currently a junior in **UC Berkeley's Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology (M.E.T.)** program, pursuing a dual degree in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science and Business Administration.
My goal in life is to create products that **empower others to fulfill their ambitions**.
At the moment, my technical interests lie in distributed systems, blockchain technology, and product management. I am also interested in tech entrepreneurship, and am an avid **boxer** in my free time!
